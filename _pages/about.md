Currently, I'm a solution engineer at VMware.

Previous experiences include specialist solution architect and consulting at Red Hat. 
I also had a short stint as an entrepreneur where I co-founded and built Jobsy into a fast growing, manpower outsourcer in Singapore, and provided leadership for Jobsy growth strategies.

I am passionate about technology and helping enterprises to digitally transformed. I help enterprises to architect and build scalable solutions with my expertise in cloud native technologies.

During my free time, I read books, write blogs and build technical contents to share with the community. My projects and demo can be found in my [GitHub](https://github.com/jiajunngjj).
