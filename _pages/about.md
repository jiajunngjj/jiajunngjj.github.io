I'm a solution engineer at VMware.

I started my tech career as a regional post sales consultant at Red Hat. After which, I moved to a regional presales role.

Prior to Red Hat, I had a short stint as an entrepreneur where I co-founded and built Jobsy into a fast growing, manpower outsourcer in Singapore, and provided leadership for Jobsy growth strategies.

I'm passionate about technology and helping organisations to digitally transformed. I architect and build scalable solutions with my expertise in cloud native technologies.

During my free time, I read books, write blogs and build technical contents to share with the community. My projects and demo can be found in my [GitHub](https://github.com/jiajunngjj).
