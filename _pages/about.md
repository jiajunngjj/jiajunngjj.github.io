I'm a solutions engineer at Snyk, working with organisations across APJ to bring cloud native application security into their IT landscape.

I started my tech career at Red Hat; first as a regional consultant in the professional services team, then a regional pre-sales solution architect. Afterwhich, I joined VMware
as a solutions engineer covering Singapore.

Prior to Red Hat, I had a short stint as an entrepreneur where I co-founded Jobsy with a few friends and built Jobsy into a fast growing, manpower outsourcer in Singapore, and provided leadership for overall growth strategies.

I'm passionate about technology and helping organisations to digitally transformed. I architect and build scalable solutions with my expertise in cloud native technologies.

During my free time, I read books, write blogs and build technical contents to share with the community. My projects and demo can be found in my [GitHub](https://github.com/jiajunngjj).
